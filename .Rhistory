stargazer(m1,m2,m3,m4,m5,m6,m7,m8,type = "text",
star.cutoffs = c(.05, .01, .001))
```
in a paper, never use the coded variable name (ex: `cond`) because that wont mean anything to the reader.
instead relabel the regression table with:
```{r}
stargazer(m1,m2,m3,m4,m5,m6,m7,m8,type = "text",
star.cutoffs = c(.05, .01, .001),
covariate.labels = c("Con Info", "Baseline Attitude", "Baseline Belief", "Democrat", "Con Info X Democrat"),
dep.var.labels = c("Attitude toward the ACA", "Belief that ACA saves costs"))
```
but we can drop non essential summary stats since they are commonly ommited on papers
```{r}
stargazer(m1,m2,m3,m4,m5,m6,m7,m8,type = "text",
star.cutoffs = c(.05, .01, .001),
covariate.labels = c("Con Info", "Baseline Attitude", "Baseline Belief", "Democrat", "Con Info X Democrat"),
dep.var.labels = c("Attitude toward the ACA", "Belief that ACA saves costs"),
keep.stat="n")
```
# AJPS Format
we can use the American Journal of Political Science format here
use this format for final paper unless theres a reason not to
```{r}
stargazer(m1,m2,m3,m4,m5,m6,m7,m8,type = "text",
star.cutoffs = c(.05, .01, .001),
covariate.labels = c("Con Info", "Baseline Attitude", "Baseline Belief", "Democrat", "Con Info X Democrat"),
dep.var.labels = c("Attitude toward the ACA", "Belief that ACA saves costs"),
keep.stat="n",
style = "ajps")
```
## In-class exercise
- Run the following models using the social pressure experiment data
- m1: regress 2006 turnout on messages
- m2: add age (2006-yearofbirth) as a control to m1
- m3: add the interaction between messages and 2004 turnout to m1
- m4: add age (2006-yearofbirth) as a control to m3
```{r}
head(social)
names(social)
# first lets change the baseline
social$messages<-fct_relevel(social$messages, "Control")
m1<-lm(primary2006~messages,social)
social$age<-2006 - social$yearofbirth
m2<-lm(primary2006~messages+age,social)
m3<-lm(primary2006~messages*primary2004,social) # tracks interaction
m3<-lm(primary2006~messages*primary2004+age,social)
```
## In-class exercise
- Create a table that reports the results of m1 to m4, using stargazer
```{r}
stargazer(m1,m4,type="text", keep.stat = "n", style="ajps")
```
example for observing interactions in the study:
non-multiplication way:
1. build two different models and compare by eye
```{r}
summary(lm(primary2006~messages,subset(social,primary2004==0)))
summary(lm(primary2006~messages,subset(social,primary2004==1)))
# can just compare coefficients here
```
using multiplication syntax:
1. make one model and get the coefficients on the interaction terms, it's the same number as before but assures accuracy
```{r}
summary(lm(primary2006~messages*primary2004,social))
```
### On CI:
- try to make your confidence interval as narrow as possible
- if the confidence interval includes 0, even if its narrow, then your finding is not stat significantly finding.
- unless you want a null finding, keep it nonzero and narrow
- ex: effect of vaccination on autism - CI is 0 on this study - incredibly unlikely that autism caused by vaccination.

Goal: Evaluate whether Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation to the Supreme Court of US, in light of the allegations of sexual assault, eroded the public confidence in the Supreme Court. We are particularly interested in investigating the possible erosion of trust among Democratic voters and women.
The survey recorded people's trust in the Supreme Court directly before and directly after the confirmation of B. Kavanaugh.
# Question 1
First load in the `bk.dta` data.
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(haven) # to read dta
library(labelled) # to manipulate metadata
library(psych) # for use of Croenbach's Alpha for inter-item reliability
library(stargazer) # for regression tables
#bk = Brett K.
bk<-read_dta("bk.dta")
```
Each column tracks a rated response to a question regarding trust in the Supreme Court, or the gender / political learning of the survey responder.
### Step 1: Create the Outcome Variable
Create the outcome variable - "trust in the Supreme Court" - using the follow up survey questions coded in `a21,a22,a23`.
First I recoded the three post-decision survey questions to fit within 0 and 1,
where 0 means that they strongly disagree and 1 means that they strongly agree
(so 0 would imply a lower confidence in the Supreme Court while 1 would imply the highest confidence in the Supreme court, post- Brett K.'s appointment)
```{r}
# need to recode to be between 0 and 1
bk$post_trust_1 <- case_when(bk$a21 >= 1 & bk$a21 <= 7 ~ (7-bk$a21)/6)
bk$post_trust_2 <- case_when(bk$a22 >= 1 & bk$a22 <= 7 ~ (7-bk$a22)/6)
# from the code book this one might be negatively correlated with trust in
# the supreme court so I will reverse it.
bk$post_trust_2 <- 1 - bk$post_trust_2
bk$post_trust_3 <- case_when(bk$a23 >= 1 & bk$a23 <= 7 ~ (7-bk$a23)/6)
# then need to do a Croenbach's Alpha inter-reliability analysis
alpha(select(bk,post_trust_1,post_trust_2,post_trust_3))
```
Since Cronbach's raw alpha value is $0.67$, these three variables are okay indicators
of the same thing - public confidence (at least in the sample) of the Supreme Court - but they are not great indicators of confidence.
I suspect that $alpha$ value for these three items is not at least $0.8$ because question 2 ($a22,sc2$) in the survey isn't as strong an indicator of a low level of confidence in the Supreme Court as it is perhaps a willingness to change the fundamental structure of the system of government in the US.
To make the index, let's take the row means.
```{r}
bk$post_trust_final <- rowMeans(select(bk,post_trust_1,post_trust_2,post_trust_3))
```
This column `post_trust_final` indexes the overall positive public opinion in the Supreme Court (for this sample) after the Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation, rated on a scale of 0 to 1.
# Question 2:
Test the hypothesis that Kavanaugh’s confirmation undercut trust in the Court, by
comparing those responded just before the confirmation (cond=0) and just after it (cond=1) using
a regression model. Report the point estimates of the intercept and slope coefficients, their
standard errors, t-value, p-value, and 95% confidence intervals. Describe the key findings in 2-3
sentences. (2 points)
The model has binary independent/predictor variable `cond`, with `cond = 0`
meaning the person was interviewed before confirmation, and `cond = 1` meaning the
person was interviewed after the confirmation (before and after treatment)
```{r}
m1<-lm(post_trust_final~factor(cond),bk)
m1
# think i need to make it a factor variable, not continuous.
# negative correlation between time surveyed and trust
summary(m1)
confint(m1)
```
#### Least Squares Estimates for the Fitted Line:
Notice we have a negative slope, corresponding to a decrease in trust for those surveyed after the confirmation of Brett Kavanaugh.
- Intercept:`r coef(m1)[1]`
- Slope:`r coef(m1)[2]`
#### Standard Error of the Estimates and t value/p value:
Used to calculate the p-value/ Confidence Interval:
- Standard Error of intercept: `0.004611 `
- Standard Error of slope: `0.006464`
- t-val of intercept: `133.413`
- t-val of slope: `-3.875`
#### p values of intercept and slope for the model:
Less than a statistically significant threshold tells us we can reject $H_0$.
- p-val of intercept: `< 2e-16`
- p-val of slope: `0.000108`
#### Confidence Interval (95%)
Gives us a range of values that the true parameter will be in 95% of the time (not the case that there is a 95% chance that the true parameter is within this range):
- 95% CI of intercept: `(Intercept)    0.60615753  0.62423892`
- 95% CI of slope: `factor(cond)1 -0.03772036 -0.01237409`
### Results for Question 2:
From these results, particularly the p-value of the slope ($0.000108$), we get that we must reject the null hypothesis $H_0$ that the confirmation of Brett Kavanaugh did not erode the public confidence in the Supreme Court. Since the p value is less than $0.01$, we can be confident in rejecting the null hypothesis $H_0$.
We also note that the true parameter for the intercept and slope will be in the range of values listed for the 95% confidence interval exactly 95% of the time, so the slope will be in between -0.03772036 and -0.01237409 95% of the time. I am not claiming that there is 95% chance that the trust slope is in between these two numbers.
# Question 3
Ceate another variable measuring people’s baseline trust in the Supreme Court
measured at the baseline (sc1, sc2, sc3). Then control for this variable (i.e., lagged DV) in each
of the models. Briefly comment on how the point estimates and standard errors change as a
result. (2 points)
First I want to recode the variable to be between 0 and 1, where 0 represents
the least trust in the supreme court (corresponds to 7, the "strongly agree" response to the questions measuring distrust in the Supreme Court. 1 represents the other end of the
scale, namely the "strongly disagree" response to the questions measuring distrust in the Supreme Court.
For the final index, the scores closer to 0 represent a lower confidence in the Supreme Court while the scores closer to 1 represent a higher confidence in the Supreme Court.
```{r}
# need to recode to be between 0 and 1
bk$base_trust_1 <- case_when(bk$sc1 >= 1 & bk$sc1 <= 7 ~ (7-bk$sc1)/6)
bk$base_trust_2 <- case_when(bk$sc2 >= 1 & bk$sc2 <= 7 ~ (7-bk$sc2)/6)
# from the code book this one might be negatively correlated with trust in
# the supreme court so I will reverse it.
bk$base_trust_2 <- 1 - bk$base_trust_2
bk$base_trust_3 <- case_when(bk$sc3 >= 1 & bk$sc3 <= 7 ~ (7-bk$sc3)/6)
alpha(select(bk,base_trust_1,base_trust_2,base_trust_3))
# the alphas might be so low because question 2 might not be a great indicator
# of distrust in the SC
bk$base_trust_final <- rowMeans(select(bk,base_trust_1,base_trust_2,base_trust_3))
```
Now we use lagged dependent variable to control for the baseline trust variable.
```{r}
# recall model 1, a simple linear regression
m1
# now [lagged DV] method gives us:
m2<-lm(post_trust_final~factor(cond)+base_trust_final,bk)
m2
summary(m2)
stargazer(m1,m2, type = 'text', style = 'ajps')
```
We can interpret these coefficients in this way. $0.09894$ represents the predicted
mean when all predicting variables are equal to zero (so this is the predicted mean for those people that were interviewed before the confirmation and also for the people who scored a 0, meaning low opinion, in the baseline opinion measure). The `base_trust_ final` coefficient, $0.84630$, shows that those who had a higher opinion of the Supreme Court in the baseline retained that higher opinion in the follow-up.
The interesting coefficient change here happens with `cond`, representing the mean difference in trust between those in the control group and treatment group. The standard errors for `cond` in the new model, `0.003793` for the slope, is less than the standard error for the slope for `cond` in model 1 (`0.006464`), it's almost halved. This means that the coefficients in the second model for `cond` will be closer to the population's true mean.
Indeed, we see the new mean difference between the control and treatment group, ` -0.017170`, is still negative but shallower once we control for the baseline trust index. So controlling for baseline trust yields a shallower slope on the line of best fit on the model, meaning the effect of the treatment is not as strong. (-0.025047 for model 1 slope vs -0.017170 for model 2).
# Question 4
Investigate whether the effect was stronger among Democrats. Also investigate
whether the effect was stronger among women. Report the point estimates of the intercept and
slope coefficients, their standard errors, t-value, p-value, and 95% confidence intervals. Describe
the key findings in 3-4 sentences. (2 points)
Part 1:
To see if the effect was stronger among Democrats, need to observe the interactions in the model. First I made political orientation a binary condition (1 if the respondent identified as a Democrat, 0 if they identified as not a Democrat). The female binary variable was already coded for us.
```{r}
# is dem is 0 if not democrat, 1 if democrat.
bk$is_dem<-case_when(((bk$pid >=4) & (bk$pid <=6)) ~ 1,
((bk$pid < 4) | (bk$pid > 6)) ~ 0)
m_dem_test<-lm(post_trust_final~factor(cond),subset(bk,is_dem==1))
coef(m_dem_test)
m_not_dem_test<-lm(post_trust_final~factor(cond),subset(bk,is_dem==0))
coef(m_not_dem_test)
m_dem<-lm(post_trust_final~factor(cond)*is_dem,bk)
summary(m_dem)
# is women model
m_women<-lm(post_trust_final~factor(cond)*female,bk)
#m_not_women<-lm(post_trust_final~factor(cond), subset(bk, female==0))
summary(m_women)
m_women
```
## Treatment effects (Tracking If Democrat):
#### Coefficients:
- Intercept of Model: $ 0.651957$
- Slope of Model: $-0.038733$
Notice that this is statistically significant, so must reject null hypothesis that being a Democrat is not a moderating effect on the effect that Kavanaugh's confirmation had on the public opinion of the Supreme Court.
#### Standard error of Estimates and t values:
- standard error of intercept: $0.006901$
- standard error of slope: $0.012766$
- t value of intercept: $94.475$
- t value of slope: $-3.034$
#### p values:
-p value of intercept: $< 2e-16 $
-p value of slope: $0.00243$
#### 95% CI:
-
-
#### Results for Democrat Interaction model:
We can see that identifying as a Democrat is a moderating factor in the the effect Kavanaugh's confirmation had on trust in the Supreme Court. We know this because the p-value for the slope tracking the interactions is statistically significant(less than $0.01$ actually).
## Treatment effects (Tracking If Woman):
#### Coefficients:
- Intercept of Model: $ $
- Slope of Model: $$
Notice that this is statistically significant, so must reject null hypothesis.
#### Standard error of Estimates and t values:
#### p values:
#### 95% CI:
# Question 5:
Question 5: Use the Penn student survey data to answer your group’s research question. The data
file `penn.dta` will be uploaded on 11/21. First, propose two specific, testable hypotheses bearing
on your general research question. Each hypothesis should state your prediction about the
relationship between two variables. For example, if your research question was “which factors
are related to Y”, you should name two specific factors (e.g., gender, ethnicity, etc.). Run
regression models to test your hypotheses. Report the point estimates of the intercept and slope
coefficients, their standard errors, t-value, p-value, and 95% confidence intervals. Describe what
these numbers mean in a few sentences. Finally, offer a succinct answer to your research
question (2 points)
- note: I ended up using the `penn.sav` file uploaded recently, not the `penn.dta` file uploaded in April 2020.
Our team wanted to investigate whether social media engagement rose after the start of the pandemic in the US (March 2020)
Hypothesis 1: After the pandemic, people went on more social media sites (the variety of sites visited increased).
Hypothesis 2: If the respondent selected more social media sites as sites they usually visit, they believed they spent too much time on social media.

- Intercept of Model: $ 0.651957$
- Slope of Model: $-0.038733$
Notice that this is statistically significant, so must reject null hypothesis that being a Democrat is not a moderating effect on the effect that Kavanaugh's confirmation had on the public opinion of the Supreme Court.
#### Standard error of Estimates and t values:
- standard error of intercept: $0.006901$
- standard error of slope: $0.012766$
- t value of intercept: $94.475$
- t value of slope: $-3.034$
#### p values:
-p value of intercept: $< 2e-16 $
-p value of slope: $0.00243$
#### 95% CI:
- CI of intercept: 0.63842719  0.66548633
- CI of slope: -0.06376098 -0.01370498
#### Results for Democrat Interaction model:
We can see that identifying as a Democrat is a moderating factor in the the effect Kavanaugh's confirmation had on trust in the Supreme Court. We know this because the p-value for the slope tracking the interactions is statistically significant(less than $0.01$ actually). From the confidence interval, we can see that the true population parameter is within -0.06376098 and -0.01370498 95% of the time.

## Treatment effects (Tracking If Woman):
#### Coefficients:
- Intercept of Model: $0.627483$
- Slope of Model: $0.002416$
Notice that this is not statistically significant, so we can not reject null hypothesis.
#### Standard error of Estimates and t values:
- standard error of intercept: $0.006673$
- standard error of slope: $0.012966$
#### p values:
- p values of intercept: $< 2e-16$
- p values of slope: $0.85218$
#### 95% CI:
- CI of intercept: $0.61439957 - 0.640567322$
- CI of slope: $-0.02300521 - 0.027837912$
#### Results (Heterogenous Effects - Women):
From this, we cannot reject the null hypothesis $H_0$ that being a woman did not have an effect on the effect of Kavanaugh's confirmation in public trust of the Supreme Court.
## Overall Results:
Overall, being a Democrat led the treatment to have a much stronger effect on the treatment eroding the respondent confidence in the Supreme Court.
# Question 5:
Question 5: Use the Penn student survey data to answer your group’s research question. The data file `penn.dta` will be uploaded on 11/21. First, propose two specific, testable hypotheses bearing
on your general research question. Each hypothesis should state your prediction about the relationship between two variables. For example, if your research question was “which factors are related to Y”, you should name two specific factors (e.g., gender, ethnicity, etc.). Run
regression models to test your hypotheses. Report the point estimates of the intercept and slope
coefficients, their standard errors, t-value, p-value, and 95% confidence intervals. Describe what
these numbers mean in a few sentences. Finally, offer a succinct answer to your research
question (2 points)
- note: I ended up using the `penn.sav` file uploaded recently, not the `penn.dta` file uploaded in April 2020.
Our team wanted to investigate whether social media engagement rose after the start of the pandemic in the US (March 2020)
Hypothesis 1: After the pandemic, the variety of sites which people used increased.
Hypothesis 2: If the respondent selected more social media sites as sites they usually visit, they believed they spent too much time on social media.
